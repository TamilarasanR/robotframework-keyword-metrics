# Keywords Performance Metrics Report in Robot Framework

Aim of this project is to create HTML report based on robot framework output.xml to analyze time took by each keyword in entire suite|test execution

*How it Works:*

1. Read output.xml file (which will be created after script execution)
2. Get Test Case Name (test tag) , Keyword Name (kw tag) , Start Time, End Time (status tag) values from output.xml file
3. Convert data to html report using Beautifulsoap (Tabular format with sorting | pagination | search feasibility )

*How to use in project:*

1. Checkout the project
2. Copy __keyword_performance_metrics_report_creator.py__ and __keyword_performance_metrics_executer.bat__ files to project (where output.xml file is available)
3. Install beautifulsoap: __pip install beautifulsoup4__  (to create html report)
4. Install lxml: __pip install lxml__ (to read data from xml file)
5. Execute keyword_performance_metrics_executer.bat file
6. "Keywords Performance Metrics Report" will be opened in new chrome tab
